# Showing my Browser skills with pure Three.js

## Quick Start

<span style="color:lightblue">Soon: LiveSite to play around in with weekly updates</span>.
The easiest way to experiment with this project right now is to clone this project locally and running the command npm run quickstart in your Terminal.

1. HTTPS: git clone https://github.com/Doubl3K/3DPort.git
   SSH: git cone git@github.com:Doubl3K/3DPort.git
2. npm run quickstart
   _This will install needed packages, open your standard browser on localhost:5173 and build the project._
3. Press the start button in your browser window. ☜(ﾟヮﾟ ☜)

## How do I contribute?

Issues are usually flagged according to what needs to be done. If you find an Issue is labeled as <span style="color:#008672">help wanted</span> or <span style="color:#7057ff">good first issue</span> that is not assigned to anyone you are more than welcome to participate write me a issue comment that you want to do it and I will let you try.
If you find a ticket that you think is interesting to you and it is already assinged to me than you can most likely still give it a try. Again just comment an I will put it on hold to let you have a crack at it.

Do keep in mind that I do by far not require perfect work. But it does have to meet a certain standard. <span style="color:red">I do not just merge eveything!</span>

1. Follow the Quick Start guide.

2. Checkout a new branch from develop
   Make sure to use the label and the ticket number as a combination for your branch
   Branchtypes: -<span style="color:#d73a4a">bugfix</span> - <span style="color:#a2eeef">feature</span> - <span style="color:#AF8EDB">design</span>

   Example: Label = <span style="color:#a2eeef">enhancement</span> + Ticket number = #26 => Branch name = feature/26

3. Make your changes that would fix the issue.
   (_Check if you are **only** comitting/pushing the parts that you changed_)
4. Write a Pullrequest(PR) for your branch towards develop
5. Have fun!

# Happy Coding :)
